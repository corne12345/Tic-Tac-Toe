# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Unit 2 from course Native App Studio

This app is an implementation of the board game tic-tac-toe.
The game is played with 2 players, one playing with crosses and the other with circles.
The goal is to get 3 of the same symbol in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

The app automatically disables the playable buttons once one of the players has three in a row.
It can be played in either landscape or portrait mode and the current game is saved while rotating.
