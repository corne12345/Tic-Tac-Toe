# Tic-Tac-Toe
Unit 2 from course Native App Studio

## Extra's
The app uses nice, specifically for this app created symbols of X and O. The use of this symbols greatly complicates the code.
Furthermore, the design was greatly updated (in both landscape and portrait mode) to give it all a more professional look.
The check for win has also been updated to be more function-like, instead of hardcoding all winning conditions.
The winning is communicated through Toasts.

## Summary
This app is an implementation of the board game tic-tac-toe.
The game is played with 2 players, one playing with crosses and the other with circles.
The goal is to get 3 of the same symbol in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

The app automatically disables the playable buttons once one of the players has three in a row.
It can be played in either landscape or portrait mode and the current game is saved while rotating.
